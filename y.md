#### Your questions are perfect.

1) It is not an easy thing for sure.
I was strugging with onboarding and first tasks assesment about the year.
Maybe in future it should be a separated project manager that will track progress of the new people.
It also can be a team lead of this project.

After failing my interns few times I find solution^ they usually stuck at setting up environment and stuff so it should be as simple as possible.
So if you want to add them to big ongoing project -> you will get a lot of pain. And everybody knows it, but I didn't realize that onboarding is so important.


So I split my projects into small chunks/modules.
To be honest -> this modules are the most clean code that i have ;)

I also adding some "robotic" scripts, so when they push their code -> it will builded and validated.

This modules then published at npmjs.org and imported to our projects.

2) I don't want to make money from students. At least right now 100%. Maybe it will change later to a paid plans, but only if will be about other things.
I mean I will get some of my tasks done(hope for this). So it is like a currency for me.
Between our interns and me.

If it will require an additioonal teachers to hire -> maybe we will make some paid stuff.
If this projects evolve, I plan to pay to my students, so I will also be "guilthy free".

I want to learn How to use a gitcoin approach.
It will also clean up the management process.

Because you wouldn't be able to assign a bad explainer task via that system.
So documentation will be very important on that point.

And I like to know that this approach will make our finances open. It looks cool.
Big number of my interns are from developing countries, so I think I want give them an opportunity to start learning for free.

I mean there a lot of cool and free places(or cheap) where you can start to learn coding. You just need to google the name of course and learn.

If or when i will see, that number of interns are owerwhelming for me(it will be a happy time for me, actually).
 I'll add an additional kwalification - it'll lover number and increase quality of team members. it will save few months of onboarning for me.

 Or I can extend number of companies like mine, that looking for coding help.
 It can be like a recommendation -> like my word or letter can be used as source of trust.

 Or I can enable a jobboard, where interns can look for a first job. There a lot of jobboards for sure, but this can have some attention too(by checking notest at PH(startups))

---

I have an idea of monetization via companies that want to validate or test their futurre employeess without moving than into their office.

It is simple: someone want to train or test their interns

They save time and spend small amount of time and I will be responsible for giving tasks to their developers.
I will care of checking skills of this student/intern.  If he/she didn't know something -> he will learn it and report to me.

We also keeping at Github, so it can be easy to see the actual progress that someone did. Commits cannot lie, you know.

---

And instead of spending their focus -> I will or someone else experienced (if this assumption will work, project will be monetized, I have an avalance of interns) will take care about it.

So for me it can be a side stream of income of cash and interns will help to build my projects.
And for some talented and hardworking people can be start of their developer carriers.

I tested my approach on different people with different skillset. It is usually works well. For sure, some people give up and abandon my remote internship, but it is normal and i am ok with that.
But if someone ready to learn and invest their time, we make a very good connection.

---

Usually it is easier for me to create
tasks, rather then finish to them, so i am ahead a bit. Sometimes, I struggle to reply quickly -> but this is how it work at real works, at companies with any sizes -> you cannot receive an immediate result

---

I think that I can easily handle 20-30 people at the same time, when I didn't code myself.

With 50 people I will add more branching/hierarcy.
So people that know more about our project will review progress of small changes.

---

But to be honest -- lets think about this when it will became a reality.

4) For tests we should have a separated place. Because right now, cannot write tests on my own.
As you asked about it - I will think about this problem more.


---

Maybe for Next steps -- I will think about details.

Давайте я покажу на примере того, как я постепенно ввожу интернов в рабочий процесс. Вначале...
