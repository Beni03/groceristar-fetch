#### Your questions are perfect.

1) It is not an easy thing for sure.
I was struggling with onboarding and first tasks assessment about the year.
Maybe in the future, it should be a separated project manager that will track the progress of the new people.
It also can be a team leader of this project.

After failing my interns a few times I find solution^ they usually stuck at setting up an environment and stuff so it should be as simple as possible.
So if you want to add them to the big ongoing project -> you will get a lot of pain. And everybody knows it, but I didn't realize that onboarding is so important.


So I split my projects into small chunks/modules.
To be honest -> these modules are the cleanest code that I have ;)

I also add some "robotic" scripts, so when they push their code -> it will build and validated.

This modules then published at npmjs.org and imported to our projects.

2) I don't want to make money from students. At least right now 100%. Maybe it will change later to paid plans, but only if will be about other things.
I mean I will get some of my tasks done(hope for this). So it is like a currency for me.
Between our interns and me.

If it will require additional teachers to hire -> maybe we will make some paid stuff.
If these projects evolve, I plan to pay for my students, so I will also be "guilt free".

I want to learn How to use a Gitcoin approach.
It will also clean up the management process.

Because you wouldn't be able to assign a bad explainer task via that system.
So documentation will be very important on that point.

And I like to know that this approach will make our finances open. It looks cool.
The big number of my interns are from developing countries, so I think I won't give them an opportunity to start learning for free.

I mean they're a lot of cool and free places(or cheap) where you can start to learn to code. You just need to google the name of the course and learn.

If or when I will see, that number of interns are overwhelming for me(it will be a happy time for me, actually).
 I'll add an additional qualification - it'll lover number and increase the quality of team members. it will save a few months of onboarding for me.

 Or I can extend a number of companies like mine, that looking for coding help.
 It can be like a recommendation -> like my word or letter can be used as a source of trust.

 ---

 Or I can enable a job board, where interns can look for a first job. There a lot of job boards for sure, but this can have some attention too(by checking notest at PH(startups))

---

I have an idea of monetization via companies that want to validate or test their future employees without moving them into their office.

It is simple: someone wants to train or test their interns

They save time and spend a small amount of time and I will be responsible for giving tasks to their developers.
I will care about checking skills of this student/intern.  If he/she didn't know something -> he will learn it and report to me.

We also keep at Github so it can be easy to see the actual progress that someone did. Commits cannot lie, you know.

---

And instead of spending their focus -> I will or someone else experienced (if this assumption will work, a project will be monetized, I have an avalanche of interns) will take care about it.

So for me, it can be a side stream of income of cash and interns will help to build my projects.
And for some talented and hardworking people can be a start of their developer carriers.

I tested my approach to different people with a different skillset. It usually works well. For sure, some people give up and abandon my remote internship, but it is normal and I am ok with that.
But if someone ready to learn and invest their time, we make a very good connection.

---

Usually, it is easier for me to create
tasks, rather than finish to them, and I am ahead a bit. Sometimes, I struggle to reply quickly -> but this is how it works at real works, at companies with any sizes -> you cannot receive an immediate result

---

I think that I can easily handle 20-30 people at the same time when I didn't code myself.

With 50 people I will add more branching/hierarchy.
So people that know more about our project will review the progress of small changes.

---

But to be honest -- let's think about this when it will become a reality.

4) For tests, we should have a separated place. Because right now, cannot write tests on my own.
As you asked about it - I will think about this problem more.


---

Maybe for Next steps -- I will think about details.

Давайте я покажу на примере того, как я постепенно ввожу интернов в рабочий процесс. Вначале...

Major communication are going via GitHub. Если я сижу онлайн, вы написали коммент - сделали mention of me -> значит я получил это сообщение. И тогда когда у меня будет время -> сразу на коммент отвечу.

При этом пытайтесь максимально вернуть мне данные, когда вы спрашиваете моей помощи. Потому что я общаюсь одновременно с разными людбми и сразу забываю о чем идет речь.

пример
У меня не получается -> sucs
У меня не получается в этой задаче сделать A, потому что B и Я попробывал C, D, E, -> неполучилось. Код мой вот, идет ссылка не на файо а на codelink, not to file.

Когда я дал таск, я сразу переключаюсь на другие задачи. Я вижу это так:
- я выдал task
- вы пишете в задачи
-это значит мне прийдется открыть, залезть в ваш код в другой вкладке понять что делать дальше и т.д.

Это все можно избежать с помощью внутренних brances и pull requests -> тогда мне сразу видно что вы делали - я потом объясню что и куда.

+ Рассказать что изменение кода в pull requests обычно сложно девелоперам понять. Я просто принимаю некачественный код(yes, sad) а сразу создаю отдельный таск, который должен направить эту проблему. Так получается легче и быстрее :(

Я сам нелюблю курсы и "стандартное" обучение. В нашей стране(моей) курсы обычно означает intertaiment.

Моя знакомая была student а popular hard-core courses, related to learning English и она все равно имеет привычку смотреть фильмы on Native language, not English... Is this problemf of courses?
No, but it is problem of habit making. Instead of pushing a big pile of information at the short time of attending the course, you should form a habit, so people will be able to continue learning and benefit from it.

Imagine someone, who want to lose weight. And you offer to then a few pieces of training from Spartan race. So, on their first train, they will be exhausted, their muscles will burn, etc.

But if they will not have the mental power to come back to you -> they will be fat. Because you didn't form a good habit.  Actually, you maybe make it worse, because you showing themselves that they are not capable to be like you.

I hired a sales manager after completion of "famous outsourcing sales" courses. Actually, they teach good things. But they were "playing in sales", so he was not ready to generate a result.

He talks a lot and doesn't hear me, while I learned how to sale on practice.

I don't have a backup or option Not to sale. If I didn't a sale -> then I wouldn't have meals in a few weeks. And you cannot be a sales manager, after reading "sales"  blog post with fancy titles "How and why and what and 5 habits of success"

So I'm only about practice. At least at first.

Here is another story. We didn't offer you air if you want a result, pay attention you can see what was done and how, and decide what to do next(And how to do it)

This is a 2 side problem^ the first problem is to teach a student to think as developer 2nd problem is to figure out what skills and how someone "solves real-lives" problems.
