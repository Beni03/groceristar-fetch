I think that I don't want to have a `default` classes like below.
by my experience, they not perfect. and usually easy to be outdated.
if we need to get or set - we can use lodash _.get, _.set

ex from: https://github.com/andrewgrewell/structy

```
class Burger extends Model {
    constructor(data) {
        // call Model constructor and pass the burger data and fieldConfig
        super(data, burgerConfig);
    }

    // even though the consumer of this Burger Model could use Burger.name, it is better
    // to document the shape of your data via getters and setters.
    getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    isFavorite() {
        return this.favorite;
    }

    setFavorite(fav) {
        // note: setters are required since the data is immutable
        // this.favorite = fav will throw
        return this.set('favorite', fav);
    }
```

I was also thinking about incorporating immutablejs stuff, but it's not a good option for us too.
