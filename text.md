TESTING

Right now our plugin contain more than 100 tests and it's not more than 30% of coverage.
Another problem is a quality of our tests. Our current tests shoudl be improved, rewritten with keeping our new changes that we have in mind
it'll just require time and внимание.

When you're developer and you're coding some metohds, sometimes you don't like to write tests.
So I think it will be important to have 2 teams, that will have a "battle" around our methods.
They will work against each other, but with a same goal of making code better.

And our project have some tests. That should require reorganization. Some part of plugin have more tests.
Other `projects` have less coverage, due to our number of attempts to write tests and as we don't have a lot of resources, our attention.








level was small.

Some tests у нас отвечают за проверку подключения json files. I have an idea of separation major tests with integration tests, but ,aybe this isll be our main goal in a few next leseases goals.
So right now we'll finish our pending and @dirty tasks@ and will be able to focus on to innovate

Идея этого проекта появилась не сразу. Хотя проблема эта у меня была всегда.
Если ты начинаешь делать какого проекта в Meal Planning, Dietary stuff, and overral Food Tech -> ты не можешь тестировать данные из faker, like lorem ipsum.
Не ну ты можешь так делать, но это не очень correct.

Поэтому когда я делал первую свою app и потом сервер
